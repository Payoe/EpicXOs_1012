Project Title - Tic Tac Toe

Project Description: 
The website will contain a program that plays a game of tic tac toe between the user and the server. The user will select whether or not they want to use x or o, and if they want to go first or second. The game will start and a 3 by 3 box will be displayed. The user will select a square at the start or after the server depending on the user's previous selection. The server will select a box at random. The sequence of code will continue until the array checks and confirms that the same symbols form a line, and will display a message win or loss which will be determined by the symbol the player chose. If no boxes are left to be selected then the game will be determined to be a stalemate. The user will then be prompted to play again and a win, loss, and stalemate counter will be displayed. 

Additionally, the program will contain two types of game modes: a player vs player system, where using the same pc you will be able to input the names of both people, and then randomly selecting who goes first, and who is x and o. Then there will be the player vs AI system, where the player will input their name, and then select x or o, and whether they want to go first or not, and then will be put up against the AI. There is also planned to be a leaderboard system that will count wins, and will display the wins for both of the gamemodes, and display who is first and second. After each game the player will be asked to play again. (Optional: We can add 2 difficulties for the AI, easy and hard, where the bot will randomly place on easy, and then on hard will try to win against the player every time.)

Functional Requirements:

-The website must be able to be interacted with by the player.

-Website should scale with minimization of the browser.

-Game should be displayed and functional by the user.

-The website should be able to keep track of the player(s) name.

-Playerâ€™s name will be within 1-20 characters in length.

-The player will not be able to place X or O on an already placed slot.

-The leaderboard must be able to track wins for the player/AI.

-There must be two options for the player to choose to play: PVP or PVB.

-The system must be able to determine who wins, who loses, and a stalemate.

-The player should be able to play again without refreshing the page.

-For PVB, the player should be able to select if they want to be X or O and play first or second.

-The website should have a neat, non-cluttered interface for the player to use.

-(Optional: AI should work properly on easy and hard difficulties.)

-(Optional: Instead of hard difficulties, the AI will scale with the amount of wins the player has.)
